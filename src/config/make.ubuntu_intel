##### REQUIRED: BLAS & LAPACK
# BLAS & LAPACK source is included with PARSEC - but you must compile it separately!
#   It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use an optimized BLAS & LAPACK library (like Intel's MKL)
#   that has been tuned for your hardware
#####

LIBLAPA =

######### RECOMMENDED: FFTW3
# FFTW libraries should be downloaded from
# www.fftw.org
# the default for this code is fftw ver 3.x
# if you wish to use fftw ver 2.x, add
# -DFFTW2 in the DEF command (please just use 3)

########### OPTIONAL: TRLANC
# TRLAN libraries are included with PARSEC - but you must compile them separately
#   and indicate that you're using them with the -DUSETRLANC flag in CPPOPT

########### OPTIONAL: BerkeleyGW Support
# BerkeleyGW should be acquired and installed separately. It is NOT included with PARSEC.
#   PARSEC makes use of .mod files generated from BerkeleyGW. This path tells it where to look.

######## OPTIONAL: ARPACK
# ARPACK libraries should be download from the net
#   As of this edit, Rice University is no longer actively updating ARPACK.
#   It is being continued as ARPACK-NG and is available freely. Build it separately

# These are usually linked automatically through your mpif90 compiler.
# You will almost certainly *not* need this

######## REQUIRED: Corresponding Fortran Compiler Flags
# These are important. After our most recent update, PARSEC is completely clear of errors according to valgrind.
# That being said, we can overwhelm the stack in many default terminal sessions. There are commands to change
# the allowed stack size in a terminal. Contact your system administrator (or turn to google) to find your appropriate command
# for optimal performance.
# You may find previously used flags in other make.<files> in this directory
#
# For optimal performance, knowledge of the specific hardware PARSEC will run on is required.

######## OPTIONAL: Change the extension for the named PARSEC executable
# This does what you think it would. In the Chelikowsky lab, we like to use .ser
#  for config files that use non-mpi components, and .mpi for the mpi variants.
#  This is entirely up to you, though.
